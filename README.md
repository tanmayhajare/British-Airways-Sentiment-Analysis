# British Airways Customer Feedback Sentiment Analysis

The decision tree model is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression problems. In the Titanic dataset, we can predict the survival of passengers using the decision tree algorithm. The decision tree model uses various features such as age, sex, ticket class, and Fare to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

## Project Workflow on Jupyter Notebook
    - Installing NLTK by running `!pip install nltk` in a code cell in Jupyter Notebook.
    - Importing the necessary libraries and download the required NLTK resources 
    - Initializeing the sentiment analyzer 
    - Iterateing over the dataset and perform sentiment analysis on each review text. Assuming the review text column is named 'review_text'
    - Adding the sentiment labels to the DataFrame 
    - Saveing the updated DataFrame to a new file if desired
